# Welcome to Mimo Services Canada

This site was created on the fly to help me learn how to put together a documentation website. ME4C stands for MkDocs-Example-4-Company. This is an example prototype doc site to automate documentation generation and maintenance using AI, and to implement documentation pipelines based on Markdown and GitHub.
